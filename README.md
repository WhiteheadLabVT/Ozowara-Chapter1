Overview: Data and Scripts for the manuscript "Western U.S. Apple Quality and Chemistry responses to Environmental Drivers" (Working Title)

Publication Information: TBD

Objectives: In this study, we examine multiple environmental and anthropogenic factors and their influence on apple fruit chemistry and quality captured in one temporal period at the beginning of harvest season. In this study, we asked the following: 
(1) How do management systems interact with broad shifts in abiotic conditions across latitude to shape: a) fruit quality (sugar content, size, firmness) and b) fruit chemistry (total phenolics, phenolic diversity, and tissue composition)? 
(2) Which specific abiotic factors are the most important drivers of fruit chemistry and quality? 
(3) Which specific management practices are the most important drivers of fruit chemistry and quality?
