physicalxclimate.R
For this I modified some things from the committee meeting and added some more analyses. 
I used a corrolation matrix to find significant relationships between variables, 
but I haven't done any analyses with those variables (e.i. ssc and weight had a positive correlation)
I also started playing around with fixed climatic variables. I have average high, low, and true temps 
from September 2021 to August 2022. In addition to that I added the proximity to water data I collected 
earlier in the year. I tried doing a PCA and it didn't wok so I'm figuring that out. 


phenxclimate.R 
I went back through and added two unknown compounds that had high peak areas and
were present in almost every chromatogram. I also realized that I messed up the 
calculations by not factoring in standard curves during the ppm portion. I've run total 
phenolics and richness with the proxy climate factors.
